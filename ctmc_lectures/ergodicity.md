# Stationarity and Ergodicity


## Overview

To be added.  

Use the distribution flow figures from markov_prop.md, this time starting from
many different distributions.

Suggests ergodicity.

We will use the following imports

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import quantecon as qe
from numba import njit

from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d import Poly3DCollection

```



## Stationary Distributions

To be added.  $\psi Q = 0$.


## Asymptotic Stabiltiy

To be added.


## Ergodicity

To be added.
