# Semigroups and Generators



## Overview

We have seen in previous lectures that every intensity matrix generates a
Markov semigroup.

The main objective of this lecture is to show that the pairing is one-to-one,
in a sense to be made precise.

We begin our discussion in an abstract setting, with an arbitrary initial
value problem.

We then give a general discussion of semigroups and generators in finite
dimensional space.

After that, we return to the Markov case and fully clarify the connection
between intensity matrices and Markov semigroups.


## Semigroups and Generators


Some discussion of the abstract Cauchy problem.

A general discussion of strongly continuous semigroups and their generators.

Introduce the notion of an infinitesimal generator.

A key result: one-to-one pairing between matrices and uniformly continuous
semigroups.
